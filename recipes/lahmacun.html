    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>For the dough:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>10 grams instant yeast</li>
        <li>10 grams salt</li>
        <li>300 milliliters warm water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the topping:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams ground lamb or beef</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, instant yeast, and salt for the dough. Gradually add warm water while stirring. Once the dough starts to come together, add the olive oil and knead until you have a smooth and elastic dough. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let the dough rise for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>While the dough is rising, prepare the topping. In a separate bowl, mix together the ground lamb or beef, finely chopped onion, minced garlic, chopped tomatoes, red and green bell peppers, tomato paste, red pepper flakes, ground cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper. Ensure all the ingredients are well combined.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 220Â°C. If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into small, individual portions. Roll each portion into a thin circular shape, about 20-25 centimeters in diameter.</li>
        <li>Place the rolled dough on a baking sheet or a preheated pizza stone if available. Spread a generous amount of the topping mixture evenly on each dough round, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Bake the lahmacun in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until the edges of the dough are golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Remove the lahmacun from the oven and garnish with freshly chopped parsley. Serve hot with lemon wedges on the side.</li>
