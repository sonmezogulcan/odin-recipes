    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe provides a simple and flavorful way to prepare kebabs using either ground lamb or beef.

These ingredients work together to create a well-seasoned and fragrant kebab mixture.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams minced lamb or beef</li>
        <li>1 medium-sized onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Wooden skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground lamb or beef, finely chopped onion, minced garlic, ground cumin, ground coriander, paprika, ground black pepper, salt, and vegetable oil. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Once the mixture is well mixed, cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Preheat your grill or barbecue to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Take the soaked wooden skewers and thread the meat mixture onto them, shaping them into long cylinders or oblong shapes. Ensure that the meat is packed firmly onto the skewers to prevent them from falling apart during cooking.</li>
        <li>Place the kebabs on the preheated grill or barbecue, and cook for about 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally, until the kebabs are browned and cooked through. The cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the kebabs and your desired level of doneness.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the kebabs from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve the kebabs hot.</li>
    </ol>
